## Troubleshooting

### I Don't See Any Collections on My Home Screen

- This plugin only works if you have collections in your Jellyfin library
- To create a collection: Select some movies/shows ‚Üí Click **"+"** ‚Üí **"Add to Collection"** ‚Üí **"New Collection"**

**Check 2: Are both plugins installed and enabled?**

2. Verify you see both plugins listed:
   - **HomeScreenSections** - must be "Active"
   - **Auto-Collections-Random-Collections** - must be "Active"
3. If either is missing, return to the [Installation](#installation) section
4. If either is disabled, click on it, enable it, and restart your server

**Check 3: Did you restart after installation?**
- Jellyfin requires a full server restart after installing plugins
- Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Restart**

### Collections Aren't Updating

This is normal behavior! Collections update:

**To force new collections to appear:**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
2. Click **Auto-Collections-Random-Collections**
3. Change the number of collections (even by 1)
4. Click **Save**
5. Restart your server

### The Plugin Isn't in the Catalog

If you can't find the plugin in the Jellyfin catalog after adding the repository:

**Option 1: Check Your Jellyfin Version**

- If needed, update Jellyfin to the latest version

**Option 2: Verify Repository Was Added**

3. Verify the URL is correct: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krught/jellyfin-plugin-auto-collections-random-collections/refs/heads/main/manifest.json`
4. If missing or incorrect, add it again following Step 2 of the installation

**Option 3: Manual Installation**
1. Download the latest `RandomCollectionsHome.dll` file from the releases page
2. Find your Jellyfin plugins folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\`
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/`
   - **Docker**: `/config/plugins/` (inside the container)
3. Create a folder called `Auto-Collections-Random-Collections` if it doesn't exist

5. Restart your Jellyfin server
6. Continue with Step 1 above to install HomeScreenSections

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How many collections should I configure?**
A: Start with 3-5. Too many can make your home screen cluttered, too few might not showcase enough content.

**Q: Can I choose which collections to show?**
A: Not currently - the plugin randomly selects from all your collections. This is by design to help you rediscover content.

**Q: Will this work with movies and TV shows?**
A: Yes! It works with any type of collection you create in Jellyfin.

**Q: Does this slow down my server?**
A: No, it's very lightweight. The plugin uses smart caching to minimize performance impact.

**Q: Can I make collections update more often?**
A: Currently, collections have a 30% chance to refresh on each home screen reload. To manually force a refresh, restart your server.

**Q: Will different users see different collections?**
A: Yes! The plugin caches collections per user, so each user can have a different set of random collections.
