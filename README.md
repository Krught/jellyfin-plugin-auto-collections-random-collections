## Configuration

### How to Change Settings

1. Log in to Jellyfin as an administrator
2. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
3. Click on **Home Sections Random Collections**
4. Adjust the settings (see below)
5. Click **Save** to apply changes
6. **Note:** Changes to settings will clear the cache and immediately select new random collections

**Quick Actions:**
- **Rerandomize Sections** button: Instantly selects new random collections without changing settings
- **Developer Mode** checkbox: Toggle debug information display on/off

### Available Settings

**Number of Random Collections**
- Controls how many random collections are displayed on the home screen
- Default: 3
- Range: 1-100 collections

**View Mode Options**
- Choose which display types are available: Portrait, Square, Landscape
- If only one is selected, all collections will use that mode
- If multiple are selected, each collection will randomly use one of the enabled modes
- All three enabled by default
- **Note:** At least one view mode must be selected

**Collection Items**
- Controls how many items from each collection are displayed on the home screen
- This is the number of movies/shows visible in each collection section
- Default: 20 items per collection
- Set to 0 to display all items from each collection

**Collection Update Interval**
- Controls how often collections are automatically refreshed (in minutes)
- Default: 1440 minutes (24 hours)
- Set to 0 to disable automatic updates
- When this interval expires, new random collections are automatically selected

**Developer Mode** (Advanced)
- When enabled, shows debug information about currently registered sections
- Displays Section ID, Collection Name, Collection ID, View Mode, and Item Count for each section
- Auto-refreshes debug info at a configurable interval (5-300 seconds, default: 60 seconds)
- Useful for troubleshooting and verifying which collections are currently displayed
- Does not affect plugin operation, only displays debug information

### How Caching Works

Collections are cached at the Jellyfin instance level:
- **Automatic refresh**: New random collections are selected after the configured interval (default: 24 hours)
- **On configuration change**: Cache is cleared and new collections are selected immediately
- **Manual refresh**: Use the `/RandomCollections/Refresh` API endpoint to force an update

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Settings Page Not Showing

**If clicking the settings button shows "no settings" error:**
- Make sure you've restarted Jellyfin after installation
- Check that the plugin is marked as "Active" in My Plugins
- Check Jellyfin logs for any errors during plugin initialization

### Can't Access the API

**Check 1: Do you have collections?**
- This plugin only works if you have collections (BoxSets) in your Jellyfin library
- To create a collection: Select some movies/shows ‚Üí Click **"+"** ‚Üí **"Add to Collection"** ‚Üí **"New Collection"**

**Check 2: Is the plugin installed and enabled?**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
2. Verify **Home Sections Random Collections** is listed and "Active"
3. If disabled, click on it, enable it, and restart your server

**Check 3: Did you restart after installation?**
- Jellyfin requires a full server restart after installing plugins
- Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Restart**

**Check 4: Check if HomeScreenSections is installed**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
2. Look for **HomeScreenSections** plugin
3. If not installed, go to Catalog and install it
4. Restart Jellyfin after installing

**Check 5: Look at the logs for detailed information**
- Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Logs**
- Look for messages from this plugin:
  - `"Found X collections in library"` - Shows detected collections
  - `"Available collection: 'Name'"` - Lists each collection found
  - `"Attempting to register home screen sections"` - Shows registration started
  - `"Successfully registered section for collection 'Name'"` - Confirms registration
  - `"HomeScreenSections plugin not found"` - Means you need to install it
- These logs will tell you exactly what the plugin is doing

### Collections Aren't Changing

This is normal behavior! Collections are cached for the configured update interval:
- ‚úÖ Collections update automatically based on the **Collection Update Interval** setting (default: 24 hours)
- ‚úÖ This provides a consistent experience and reduces server load
- ‚úÖ All users see the same collections (instance-level, not per-user)

**To force new collections immediately:**
- Click the **Rerandomize Sections** button in the plugin settings page
- Or use the API endpoint: `POST /RandomCollections/Refresh`
- Or change any plugin setting and save (this clears the cache)
- Or adjust the **Collection Update Interval** to refresh more frequently

### The Plugin Isn't in the Catalog

If you can't find the plugin in the Jellyfin catalog after adding the repository:

**Option 1: Check Your Jellyfin Version**
- This plugin requires Jellyfin **10.9.0 or higher**
- Check your version: **Dashboard** ‚Üí Look at the top for version number
- If needed, update Jellyfin to the latest version

**Option 2: Verify Repository Was Added**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **Repositories**
2. Check that you see the repository: `@Krught (Home Sections Random Collections)`
3. Verify the URL is correct: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krught/jellyfin-plugin-home-sections-random-collections/refs/heads/main/manifest.json`
4. If missing or incorrect, add it again following Step 2 of the installation

**Option 3: Manual Installation**
1. Download the latest `RandomCollectionsHome.dll` file from the releases page
2. Find your Jellyfin plugins folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\`
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/`
   - **Docker**: `/config/plugins/` (inside the container)
3. Create a folder called `Home-Sections-Random-Collections` if it doesn't exist
4. Copy the `.dll` file into that folder
5. Restart your Jellyfin server
6. Continue with Step 1 above to install HomeScreenSections

### Still Having Issues?

**Check the Logs:**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Logs**
2. Look for entries containing `Jellyfin.Plugin.RandomCollectionsHome`
3. The plugin now uses proper ILogger for comprehensive logging
4. Look for error messages that might explain the issue

**Common Log Messages:**
- **"Found {Count} collections in library"** ‚Üí Shows how many collections were detected
- **"No collections found in library"** ‚Üí Create at least one collection
- **"Successfully registered section for collection '{CollectionName}'"** ‚Üí Collection added to home screen
- **"Auto-updating collections for user {UserId}"** ‚Üí Collections being refreshed after interval expires

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do I display collections on my home screen?**
A: You need to install the **HomeScreenSections** plugin. This plugin automatically registers sections with HomeScreenSections to display random collections on your home screen.

**Q: How many collections should I configure?**
A: Start with 3-5. You can adjust the "Number of Random Collections" setting based on your preference.

**Q: Can I choose which collections to show?**
A: Not currently - the plugin randomly selects from all your collections. This is by design to help you rediscover content.

**Q: Will this work with movies and TV shows?**
A: Yes! It works with any type of collection (BoxSet) you create in Jellyfin.

**Q: Does this slow down my server?**
A: No, it's very lightweight. The plugin uses caching to minimize performance impact, only refreshing at the configured interval.

**Q: Are collections different for each user?**
A: No, collections are selected at the Jellyfin instance level. All users see the same random collections that update at the configured interval.

**Q: How many items from each collection are shown?**
A: This is controlled by the **Collection Items** setting (default: 20). This determines how many movies/shows are displayed in each collection section on your home screen. Set it to 0 to show all items from each collection.

**Q: How do I see which collections are currently displayed?**
A: Enable **Developer Mode** in the plugin settings. This will show debug information including Section ID, Collection Name, View Mode, and Item Count for each currently displayed collection.
