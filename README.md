## Configuration

### How to Change Settings

1. Log in to Jellyfin as an administrator
2. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
3. Click on **Home Sections Random Collections**
4. Adjust the settings (see below)
5. Click **Save**
6. **Restart your server** for changes to take effect

### Available Settings

**Number of Random Collections**
- Controls how many random collections are returned by the API
- Default: 3
- Example: If set to 5, the API will return 5 different random collections for each user

### When Do Collections Update?

Collections use smart caching per user:
- **70% of the time**: Cached collections are returned (prevents excessive randomization)
- **30% of the time**: New random collections are selected
- **On configuration change**: Cache is cleared and new collections are selected
- **Manual refresh**: Use the `/RandomCollections/Refresh` endpoint

---

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Settings Page Not Showing

**If clicking the settings button shows "no settings" error:**
- Make sure you've restarted Jellyfin after installation
- Check that the plugin is marked as "Active" in My Plugins
- Check Jellyfin logs for any errors during plugin initialization

### Can't Access the API

**Check 1: Do you have collections?**
- This plugin only works if you have collections (BoxSets) in your Jellyfin library
- To create a collection: Select some movies/shows ‚Üí Click **"+"** ‚Üí **"Add to Collection"** ‚Üí **"New Collection"**

**Check 2: Is the plugin installed and enabled?**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
2. Verify **Home Sections Random Collections** is listed and "Active"
3. If disabled, click on it, enable it, and restart your server

**Check 3: Did you restart after installation?**
- Jellyfin requires a full server restart after installing plugins
- Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Restart**

**Check 4: Check if HomeScreenSections is installed**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **My Plugins**
2. Look for **HomeScreenSections** plugin
3. If not installed, go to Catalog and install it
4. Restart Jellyfin after installing

**Check 5: Look at the logs for detailed information**
- Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Logs**
- Look for messages from this plugin:
  - `"Found X collections in library"` - Shows detected collections
  - `"Available collection: 'Name'"` - Lists each collection found
  - `"Attempting to register home screen sections"` - Shows registration started
  - `"Successfully registered section for collection 'Name'"` - Confirms registration
  - `"HomeScreenSections plugin not found"` - Means you need to install it
- These logs will tell you exactly what the plugin is doing

### Collections Aren't Changing

This is normal behavior! The plugin uses smart caching:
- ‚úÖ 70% of the time: Returns cached collections (consistent experience)
- ‚úÖ 30% of the time: Selects new random collections
- ‚úÖ On configuration change: Cache is cleared

**To force new collections:**
- Use the API endpoint: `POST /RandomCollections/Refresh`
- Or change the plugin configuration and save

### The Plugin Isn't in the Catalog

If you can't find the plugin in the Jellyfin catalog after adding the repository:

**Option 1: Check Your Jellyfin Version**
- This plugin requires Jellyfin **10.9.0 or higher**
- Check your version: **Dashboard** ‚Üí Look at the top for version number
- If needed, update Jellyfin to the latest version

**Option 2: Verify Repository Was Added**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Plugins** ‚Üí **Repositories**
2. Check that you see the repository: `@Krught (Home Sections Random Collections)`
3. Verify the URL is correct: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Krught/jellyfin-plugin-home-sections-random-collections/refs/heads/main/manifest.json`
4. If missing or incorrect, add it again following Step 2 of the installation

**Option 3: Manual Installation**
1. Download the latest `RandomCollectionsHome.dll` file from the releases page
2. Find your Jellyfin plugins folder:
   - **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\Jellyfin\Server\plugins\`
   - **Linux**: `/var/lib/jellyfin/plugins/`
   - **Docker**: `/config/plugins/` (inside the container)
3. Create a folder called `Home-Sections-Random-Collections` if it doesn't exist
4. Copy the `.dll` file into that folder
5. Restart your Jellyfin server
6. Continue with Step 1 above to install HomeScreenSections

### Still Having Issues?

**Check the Logs:**
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Logs**
2. Look for entries containing `Jellyfin.Plugin.RandomCollectionsHome`
3. The plugin now uses proper ILogger for comprehensive logging
4. Look for error messages that might explain the issue

**Common Log Messages:**
- **"Found {Count} collections in library"** ‚Üí Shows how many collections were detected
- **"No collections found in library"** ‚Üí Create at least one collection
- **"Plugin instance is null"** ‚Üí The plugin failed to initialize properly
- **"Getting random collections for user {UserId}"** ‚Üí Normal operation
